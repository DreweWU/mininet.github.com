Detailed instructions for editing the Mininet web page, mostly tested.  It looks more involved than it really is.  Once someone runs through these, should go on a Contribute web page.

# Install Octopress
# see http://octopress.org/docs/setup/

# Grab Mininet website source.  
git clone -b source git@github.com:mininet/mininet.github.com.git
# RVM will may about a script there to use Ruby 1.9.3+.
cd mininet.github.com

# Preview the site by spawning a lightweight web server on port 4000:
rake preview
# To view, open a web browser to localhost:4000.

# In theory, to start up a server to update the blog upon changes:
rake watch
# In practice, doesn't seem to update properly when you change CSS or other files - probably not watching all the custom files.  

# Re-generate all website output files when changing anything:
rake generate

# Some more interesting pages to mod:
# Index: source/index.markdown
# Side navbar: source/_includes/custom/asides/sidenav.html
# Main CSS changes in Sass: sass/custom/_styles.scss

# To add a new page:
rake new_page[insert_name_here]
# Then mod the generated markdown page (path will be printed) and run 'rake generate'.

# To add a new post:
rake new_post[insert_name_here]
# The top stuff between the three-dash lines in the generated index.markdown file is the YAML front matter.
# Make sure to add 'author', followed by a colon, space, and your name.

# When you've made changes, push the update/send a pull request to the source directory.
git commit
git push origin source

# More notes on Octopress GitHub deployment here:
# http://octopress.org/docs/deploying/github/ 
# Setup _deploy dir w/website source repo:
rake setup_github_pages_additional[git@github.com:mininet/mininet.github.com.git]

# To update the actual GitHub pages site, run this command:
rake deploy
# This will generate a commit message with the current date/time apply the changes on top of whatever was there previously.  

# IMPORTANT - make sure to update the source directory!  Otherwise your changes might get overwritten.
git push origin source
