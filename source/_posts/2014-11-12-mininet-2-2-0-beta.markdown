Mininet 2.2.0 is coming soon! This release will provides a number of bug fixes as well as
several new features, including:

* Improved OpenFlow 1.3 support

  - `mn --switch ovs,protocols=openflow13` starts OVS in 1.3 mode
  - `install.sh -w` installs 1.3-compatible Wireshark dissector using
    Loxigen
    - `install.sh -y` installs the Ryu 1.3-compatible controller

* A new `nodelib.py` node library, and new `Node` types including
  `LinuxBridge`, `OVSBridge`, `LinuxRouter` and `NAT`<br>

* An improved MiniEdit GUI (`examples/miniedit.py`) - thanks to

* Support for multiple `--custom` arguments to `mn`

  `mn --custom mytopo.py,myswitch.py --topo mytopo --switch myswitch`

* Experimental cluster support - consult the
  [documentation](http://docs.mininet.org) for details -
  as well as `examples/cluster.py` and an experimental `--cluster`
  option for topologies built with the default `Host` and `OVSSwitch`
  classes:

  `mn --cluster localhost,server1,server2`

Note that examples contain experimental features which might
"graduate" into mainline Mininet in the future, but they should
not be considered a stable part of the Mininet API!

The latest Mininet source code is available on
[github]([http://github.com/mininet/mininet) and also via
[code.mininet.org](http://code.mininet.org).

Additional information on the Mininet 2.2.0 beta may be found in the
release notes on [docs.mininet.org](http://docs.mininet.org).
